# React Test Project

## Frontend React Implementation

### Overview
The frontend of the React Test project is developed using React, with specific details outlined in the attached files. Notable features and technologies include Typescript for enhanced typing, i18next for language switching, and Ant Design for efficient layout organization.

### Button Styling
The layout incorporates a visually appealing button design utilizing Ant Design. Additionally, custom CSS is employed to create various button shapes. The color scheme chosen for the buttons consists of #ffa200 and #6eda78.

### Button Interactions
Each button serves a unique purpose in managing webpage interactions:
- **Move Shape:** Moves the shape below and rotates it to the left.
- **Move Position:** Swaps the grid layout up and down.
- Clicking on buttons with different shapes triggers a random repositioning of the shapes.

## Single Page Application (SPA) with Ant Design - Personal Data Management

### Overview
The SPA is designed for efficient personal data management. The focus is on creating, editing, and deleting personal data entries with seamless user interactions.

### Data Handling
Data persistence is a crucial aspect of the application, achieved by managing Create, Edit, and Delete operations on local storage. This ensures that user-entered information remains intact even after a page refresh.

### State Management
Redux-toolkit is employed to manage the state of form data, offering a more structured and efficient alternative to the traditional useState hook.

### Table Functionality
The data table boasts advanced features such as pagination and sorting for a more user-friendly experience. Users can conveniently select and delete specific entries based on their preferences.

## Conclusion
The React Test project demonstrates a comprehensive implementation of frontend React development and a robust Single Page Application for personal data management. The use of cutting-edge technologies, thoughtful button interactions, and effective data handling contribute to a well-rounded and user-friendly application.
